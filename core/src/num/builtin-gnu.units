# Brief Philosophy of this file
#
# Most unit definitions are made in terms of integers or simple fractions of
# other definitions.  The typical exceptions are when converting between two
# different unit systems, or the values of measured physical constants.  In
# this file definitions are given in the most natural and revealing way in
# terms of integer factors.
#
# If you make changes be sure to run 'units --check' to check your work.
#
# The file is USA-centric, but there is some modest effort to support other
# countries.  This file is now coded in UTF-8.  To support environments where
# UTF-8 is not available, definitions that require this character set are
# wrapped in !utf8 directives.
#
# When a unit name is used in different countries with the different meanings
# the system should be as follows:
#
# Suppose countries ABC and XYZ both use the "foo".  Then globally define
#
#   ABCfoo  <some value>
#   XYZfoo  <different value>
#
# Then, using the !locale directive, define the "foo" appropriately for each of
# the two countries with a definition like
#
# !locale ABC
#    foo  ABCfoo

# SI units
#
# On 20 May 2019, the SI was revised to define the units by fixing the
# values of physical constants that depend on those units.
#
# https://www.nist.gov/si-redefinition/
#
# The BIPM--the International Bureau of Weights and Measures--provides a
# succinct description of the new SI in its Concise Summary:
#
# https://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si-brochure/SI-Brochure-9-concise-EN.pdf
#
#     The SI is the system of units in which:
#
#       *  the unperturbed ground state hyperfine transition frequency of the
#          caesium 133 atom is delta nu_Cs = 9 192 631 770 Hz,
#       *  the speed of light in vacuum, c, is 299 792 458 m/s,
#       *  the Planck constant, h, is 6.626 070 15 * 10^-34 J s,
#       *  the elementary charge, e, is 1.602 176 634 * 10^-19 C,
#       *  the Boltzmann constant, k, is 1.380 649 * 10^-23 J/K,
#       *  the Avogadro constant, N_A, is 6.022 140 76 * 10^23 mol^-1,
#       *  the luminous efficacy of monochromatic radiation of frequency
#          540 * 10^12 Hz, K_cd, is 683 lm/W,
#
#     where the hertz, joule, coulomb, lumen, and watt, with unit symbols Hz,
#     J, C, lm, and W, respectively, are related to the units second, metre,
#     kilogram, ampere, kelvin, mole, and candela, with unit symbols s, m, kg,
#     A, K, mol, and cd, respectively, according to Hz = s^–1, J = kg m^2 s^–2,
#     C = A s, lm = cd m^2 m^–2 = cd sr, and W = kg m^2 s^–3.
# 
#     These definitions specify the exact numerical value of each constant when
#     its value is expressed in the corresponding SI unit.  By fixing the exact
#     numerical value the unit becomes defined, since the product of the
#     numerical value and the unit has to equal the value of the constant,
#     which is invariant.
# 
#     The defining constants have been chosen such that, when taken together,
#     their units cover all of the units of the SI.  In general, there is no
#     one-to-one correspondence between the defining constants and the SI base
#     units.  Any SI unit is a product of powers of these seven constants and a
#     dimensionless factor.
# 
# Until 2018, the SI was defined in terms of base units and derived units.
# These categories are no longer essential in the SI, but they are maintained
# in view of their convenience and widespread use.  They are arguably more
# intuitive than the new definitions.  (They are also essential to the
# operation of GNU units.)  The definitions of the base units, which follow
# from the definition of the SI in terms of the seven defining constants, are
# given below.
#

s         !      # The second, symbol s, is the SI unit of time.  It is defined
second    s      # by taking the fixed numerical value of the unperturbed
                 # ground-state hyperfine transition frequency of the
                 # cesium-133 atom to be 9 192 1631 770 when expressed in the
                 # unit Hz, which is equal to 1/s.  
                 #
                 # This definition is a restatement of the previous one, the
                 # duration of 9192631770 periods of the radiation corresponding
                 # to the cesium-133 transition. 

c         299792458 m/s   # speed of light in vacuum (exact)

m         !      # The metre, symbol m, is the SI unit of length.  It is
meter     m      # defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the speed
metre     m      # of light in vacuum, c, to be 299 792 458 when expressed in
                 # units of m/s.
                 #
                 # This definition is a rewording of the previous one and is
                 # equivalent to defining the meter as the distance light
                 # travels in 1|299792458 seconds.  The meter was originally
                 # intended to be 1e-7 of the length along a meridian from the
                 # equator to a pole.

h         6.62607015e-34 J s # Planck constant (exact)

kg        !      # The kilogram, symbol kg, is the SI unit of mass.  It is
kilogram  kg     # defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the Planck
                 # constant, h, to be 6.626 070 15 * 10^-34 when expressed in
                 # the unit J s which is equal to kg m^2 / s.
                 # 
                 # One advantage of fixing h to define the kilogram is that this
                 # affects constants used to define the ampere.  If the kg were
                 # defined by directly fixing the mass of something, then h
                 # would be subject to error.
                 #
                 # The previous definition of the kilogram was the mass of the
                 # international prototype kilogram.  The kilogram was the last
                 # unit whose definition relied on reference to an artifact.
                 #
                 # It is not obvious what this new definition means, or
                 # intuitively how fixing Planck's constant defines the
                 # kilogram.  To define the kilogram we need to give the mass
                 # of some reference in kilograms.  Previously the prototype in
                 # France served as this reference, and it weighed exactly 1
                 # kg.  But the reference can have any weight as long as you
                 # know the weight of the reference.  The new definition uses
                 # the "mass" of a photon, or more accurately, the mass
                 # equivalent of the energy of a photon.  The energy of a
                 # photon depends on its frequency.  If you pick a frequency,
                 # f, then the energy of the photon is hf, and hence the mass
                 # equivalent is hf/c^2.  If we reduce this expression using
                 # the constant defined values for h and c the result is a
                 # value in kilograms for the mass-equivalent of a photon of
                 # frequency f, which can therefore define the size of the
                 # kilogram.
                 #
                 # For more on the relationship between mass an Planck's
                 # constant:
                 #
                 # https://www.nist.gov/si-redefinition/kilogram-mass-and-plancks-constant
                 # This definition may still seem rather abstract: you can't
                 # place a "kilogram of radiation" on one side of a balance.
                 # Metrologists realize the kilogram using a Kibble Balance, a
                 # device which relates mechanical energy to electrical energy
                 # and can measure mass with extreme accuracy if h is known.

                 # The boltzmann constant establishes the relationship between

                 #
                 # The previous definition of the kelvin was based on the

                 # kelvin will not have much effect on measurement practice.
                 # Practical temperature calibration makes use of two scales,
                 # the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90), which
                 # covers the range of 0.65 K to 1357.77K and the Provisional
                 # Low Temperature Scale of 2000 (PLTS-2000), which covers the
                 # range of 0.9 mK to 1 K.
                 # https://www.bipm.org/en/committees/cc/cct/publications-cc.html
                 #
                 # The ITS-90 contains 17 reference points including things
                 # like the triple point of hydrogen (13.8033 K) or the
                 # freezing point of gold (1337.33 K), and of course the triple
                 # point of water.  The PLTS-2000 specifies four reference
                 # points, all based on properties of helium-3.

A         !      # The ampere, symbol A, is the SI unit of electric current.
ampere    A      # It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the

                 # expressed in the unit C, which is equal to A*s.
                 #
                 # The previous definition was the current which produces a
                 # force of 2e-7 N/m between two infinitely long wires a meter

                 # Under the previous SI system, these constants had official
                 # fixed values, defined in 1990.  This created a situation
                 # where the standard values for the volt and ohm were in some
                 # sense outside of SI because they depended primarily on

                 # definitions that derive from SI instead of the conventional

                 #
                 # In fact we know that there is a small offset between the
                 # conventional values of the electrical units based on the
                 # conventional 1990 values and the SI values.  The new
                 # definition, which brings the practical electrical units back
                 # into SI, will lead to a one time change of +0.1ppm for
                 # voltage values and +0.02ppm for resistance values.
                 #
                 # The previous definition resulted in fixed exact values for
                 # the vacuum permeability (mu0), the impedance of free space
                 # (Z0), the vacuum permittivity (epsilon0), and the Coulomb
                 # constant. With the new definition, these four values are

mol       !      # The mole, symbol mol, is the SI unit of amount of
mole      mol    # substance.  One mole contains exactly 6.022 140 76 * 10^23
                 # elementary entities.  This number is the fixed numerical
                 # value of the Avogadro constant, N_A, when expressed in the
                 # unit 1/mol and is called the Avogadro number.  The amount of
                 # substance, symbol n, of a system is a measure of the number
                 # of specified elementary entities.  An elementary entity may
                 # be an atom, a molecule, an ion, an electron, any other
                 # particle or specified group of particles.
                 #
                 # The atomic mass unit (u) is defined as 1/12 the mass of
                 # carbon-12.  Previously the mole was defined so that a mole
                 # of carbon-12 weighed exactly 12g, or N_A u = 1 g/mol
                 # exactly. This relationship is now an experimental, 
                 # approximate relationship.
                 #
                 # To determine the size of the mole, researchers used spheres
                 # of very pure silicon-28 that weighed a kilogram.  They
                 # measured the molar mass of Si-28 using mass spectrometry and
                 # used X-ray diffraction interferometry to determine the
                 # spacing of the silicon atoms in the sphere.  Using the
                 # sphere's volume it was then possible to determine the number
                 # of silicon atoms in the sphere, and hence determine the
                 # Avogadro constant.  The results of this experiment were used to 
                 # define N_A, which is henceforth a fixed, unchanging quantity.  
                 
cd        !      # The candela, symbol cd, is the SI unit of luminous intensity
candela   cd     # in a given direction.  It is defined by taking the fixed
                 # numerical value of the luminous efficacy of monochromatic
                 # radiation of the frequency 540e12 Hz to be 683 when
                 # expressed in the unit lumen/watt, which is equal to
                 # cd sr/W, or cd sr s^3/kg m^2
                 #
                 # This definition is a rewording of the previous definition.
                 # Luminous intensity differs from radiant intensity (W/sr) in
                 # that it is adjusted for human perceptual dependence on
         # wavelength.  The frequency of 540e12 Hz (yellow;
         # wavelength approximately 555 nm in vacuum) is where human
         # perception is most efficient.
#
# The radian and steradian are defined as dimensionless primitive units.
# The radian is equal to m/m and the steradian to m^2/m^2 so these units are
# dimensionless.  Retaining them as named units is useful because it allows
# clarity in expressions and makes the meaning of unit definitions more clear.
# These units will reduce to 1 in conversions but not for sums of units or for
# arguments to functions.
#

radian    !dimensionless   # The angle subtended at the center of a circle by
                           #   an arc equal in length to the radius of the
                           #   circle

# A primitive non-SI unit
#

bit       !      # Basic unit of information (entropy).  The entropy in bits
                 #   of a random variable over a finite alphabet is defined
                 #   to be the sum of -p(i)*log2(p(i)) over the alphabet where
                 #   p(i) is the probability that the random variable takes
                 #   on the value i.

# Currency: the primitive unit of currency is defined in currency.units. 
# It is usually the US$ or the euro, but it is user selectable.

# In 1741 Anders Celsius introduced a temperature scale with water boiling at
# 0 degrees and freezing at 100 degrees at standard pressure. After his death
# the fixed points were reversed and the scale was called the centigrade
# scale.  Due to the difficulty of accurately measuring the temperature of
# melting ice at standard pressure, the centigrade scale was replaced in 1954
# by the Celsius scale which is defined by subtracting 273.15 from the
# temperature in Kelvins.  This definition differed slightly from the old
# centigrade definition, but the Kelvin scale depends on the triple point of
# water rather than a melting point, so it can be measured accurately.

# Fahrenheit defined his temperature scale by setting 0 to the coldest
# temperature he could produce in his lab with a salt water solution and by
# setting 96 degrees to body heat.  In Fahrenheit's words:
#
#    Placing the thermometer in a mixture of sal ammoniac or sea
#    salt, ice, and water a point on the scale will be found which
#    is denoted as zero. A second point is obtained if the same
#    mixture is used without salt. Denote this position as 30. A
#    third point, designated as 96, is obtained if the thermometer
#    is placed in the mouth so as to acquire the heat of a healthy
#    man."  (D. G. Fahrenheit, Phil. Trans. (London) 33, 78, 1724)

# Units cannot handle wind chill or heat index because they are two variable
# functions, but they are included here for your edification.  Clearly these
# equations are the result of a model fitting operation.
#
# wind chill index (WCI) a measurement of the combined cooling effect of low
#      air temperature and wind on the human body. The index was first defined
#      by the American Antarctic explorer Paul Siple in 1939. As currently used
#      by U.S. meteorologists, the wind chill index is computed from the
#      temperature T (in °F) and wind speed V (in mi/hr) using the formula:
#          WCI = 0.0817(3.71 sqrt(V) + 5.81 - 0.25V)(T - 91.4) + 91.4.
#      For very low wind speeds, below 4 mi/hr, the WCI is actually higher than
#      the air temperature, but for higher wind speeds it is lower than the air
#      temperature.
#
# heat index (HI or HX) a measure of the combined effect of heat and
#      humidity on the human body. U.S. meteorologists compute the index
#      from the temperature T (in °F) and the relative humidity H (as a
#      value from 0 to 1).
#        HI = -42.379 + 2.04901523 T + 1014.333127 H - 22.475541 TH
#             - .00683783 T^2 - 548.1717 H^2 + 0.122874 T^2 H + 8.5282 T H^2

                        #   the volt.  The Josephson effect occurs when two
                        #   superconductors are separated by a thin insulating
                        #   layer.  A "supercurrent" flows across the insulator

R_K90 25812.807 ohm      # Measurement of the ohm also presents difficulties.
R_K   h/electroncharge^2 #   The old approach involved maintaining resistances

                         #   based on the Hall effect.  When a current carrying
                         #   ribbon is placed in a magnetic field, a potential
                         #   difference develops across the ribbon.  The ratio
                         #   of the potential difference to the current is
                         #   called the Hall resistance.  Klaus von Klitzing
                         #   discovered in 1980 that the Hall resistance varies
                         #   in discrete jumps when the magnetic field is very
                         #   large and the temperature very low.  This enables
                         #   accurate realization of the resistance h/e^2 in the
                         #   lab.  The 1990 value was an exact conventional 
                         #   value used until the SI revision in 2019. This value
                         #   did not agree with measurements.  The new value
                         #   is exact.

# The 2019 update to SI gives exact definitions for R_K and K_J.  Previously
# the electromagnetic units were realized using the 1990 conventional values
# for these constants, and as a result, the standard definitions were in some
# sense outside of SI.  The revision corrects this problem.  The definitions
# below give the 1990 conventional values for the electromagnetic units in

# Electromagnetic CGS Units
# 
# For measuring electromagnetic quantities in SI, we introduce the new base
# dimension of current, define the ampere to measure current, and derive the
# other electromagnetic units from the ampere.  With the CGS units one approach
# is to use the basic equations of electromagnetism to define units that
# eliminate constants from those equations.  Coulomb's law has the form
#
#          F = k_C q1 q2 / r^2
#
# where k_C is the Coulomb constant equal to 1|4 pi epsilon0 in SI units.
# Ampere's force law takes the form
#
#          dF/dl = 2 k_A I1 I2 / r
#
# where k_A is the ampere constant.  In the CGS system we force either k_C or
# k_A to 1 which then defines either a unit for charge or a unit for current.
# The other unit then becomes a derived unit.  When k_C is 1 the ESU system
# results.  When k_A is 1 the EMU system results.  Note that these parameters
# are not independent of each other: Maxwell's equations indicate that
#         
#           k_C / k_A = c^2
#
# where c is the speed of light. 
#
# One more choice is needed to define a complete system.  Using Coulomb's law
# we define the electric field as the force per unit charge
#
#           E = k_C 1 / r^2.
#
# But what about the magnetic field?  It is derived from Ampere's law but we
# have the option of adding a proportionality constant, k_B, that may have
# dimensions:
#
#           B = 2 k_A k_B I / r
#
# We can choose k_B = 1, which is done in the SI, ESU and EMU systems.  But if
# instead we give k_B units of length/time then the magnetic field has
# the same units as the electric field.  This choice leads to the Gaussian
# system.
#
# The relations above are used to determine the dimensions, but the units are
# derived from the base units of CGS, not directly from those formulas.  We
# will use the notation [unit] to refer to the dimension of the unit in
# brackets.  This same process gives rise to the SI units such as the tesla, 
# which is defined by
#
#          B = 2

# Electromagnetic CGS (EMU)
#
# The abampere is the fundamental unit of this system, with the derived units
# using the ab- prefix.  The dimensions of the abampere are defined by assuming
# that k_A=1, which 
#
#            [dyne / cm]  = [2 abampere^2 / cm]
#
# where the brackets indicate taking the dimension of the unit in base units
# and discarding any constant factors.  This results in the definition from
# base CGS units of:
#
#            abampere = sqrt(dyne). 
#
# The abampere is also called the biot.  The magnetic field unit (the gauss)
# follows from the assumption that k_B=1, which means
#
#            B = 2 I / r,
#
# and hence the dimensions of the gauss are given by
#
#            [gauss] = [2 abampere / cm]
#
# or rewriting in terms of the base units
#
#            gauss = abampere / cm.
#
# The definition given below is different because it is in a form that
# gives a valid reduction for SI and ESU and still gives the correct 
# result in EMU.  (It can be derived from Faraday's law.)  
#
# The EMU system was developed by Gauss and Weber and formalized as a system in
# a committee report by the British Association for the Advancement of Science
# in 1873.

# Electromagnetic CGS (Gaussian)
#
# The Gaussian system uses the statcoulomb and statamp from the ESU system
# derived by setting k_C=1, but it defines the magnetic field unit differently
# by taking k_B=c instead of k_B=1.  As noted above, k_C and k_A are not
# independent.  With k_C=1 we must have k_A=c^-2.  This results in the magnetic
# field unit, the gauss, having dimensions give by:
#
#         [gauss] = [2 (c^-2) c statamp / cm] = [statamp / c cm]
#
# We then define the gauss using base CGS units to obtain
#
#         gauss = statamp / ((cm/s) cm) = statcoulomb / cm^2.
#
# Note that this definition happens to give the same result as the definition
# for the EMU system, so the definitions of the gauss are consistent.
#
# This definition gives the same dimensions for the E and B fields and was also
# known as the "symmetric system".  This system was proposed by Hertz in 1888.

# Photographic Exposure Value
# This section by Jeff Conrad (jeff_conrad@msn.com)
#
# The Additive system of Photographic EXposure (APEX) proposed in ASA
# PH2.5-1960 was an attempt to simplify exposure determination for people who
# relied on exposure tables rather than exposure meters.  Shortly thereafter,
# nearly all cameras incorporated exposure meters, so the APEX system never
# caught on, but the concept of exposure value remains in use.  Though given as
# 'Ev' in ASA PH2.5-1960, it is now more commonly indicated by 'EV'.  EV is
# related to exposure parameters by
#
#            A^2   LS   ES
#     2^EV = --- = -- = --
#             t    K    C
#
# Where
#     A = Relative aperture (f-number)
#     t = Exposure time in seconds
#     L = Scene luminance in cd/m2
#     E = Scene illuminance in lux
#     S = Arithmetic ISO speed
#     K = Reflected-light meter calibration constant
#     C = Incident-light meter calibration constant
#
# Strictly, an exposure value is a combination of aperture and exposure time,
# but it's also commonly used to indicate luminance (or illuminance).
# Conversion to luminance or illuminance units depends on the ISO speed and the
# meter calibration constant.  Common practice is to use an ISO speed of 100.
# Calibration constants vary among camera and meter manufacturers: Canon,
# Nikon, and Sekonic use a value of 12.5 for reflected-light meters, while
# Kenko (formerly Minolta) and Pentax use a value of 14.  Kenko and Sekonic use
# a value of 250 for incident-light meters with flat receptors.
#
# The values for in-camera meters apply only averaging, weighted-averaging, or
# spot metering--the multi-segment metering incorporated in most current
# cameras uses proprietary algorithms that evaluate many factors related to the
# luminance distribution of what is being metered; they are not amenable to
# simple conversions, and are usually not disclosed by the manufacturers.

# Other Photographic Exposure Conversions
# 
# As part of APEX, ASA PH2.5-1960 proposed several logarithmic quantities
# related by
#
#    Ev = Av + Tv = Bv + Sv
#
# where
#  Av = log2(A^2)       Aperture value
#  Tv = log2(1/t)       Time value
#  Sv = log2(N Sx)      Speed value
#  Bv = log2(B S / K)   Luminance ("brightness") value
#  Iv = log2(I S / C)   Illuminance value
#
# and
#  A  = Relative aperture (f-number)
#  t  = Exposure time in seconds
#  Sx = Arithmetic ISO speed in 1/lux s
#  B  = luminance in cd/m2
#  I  = luminance in lux

# The constant N derives from the arcane relationship between arithmetic
# and logarithmic speed given in ASA PH2.5-1960.  That relationship
# apparently was not obvious--so much so that it was thought necessary
# to explain it in PH2.12-1961.  The constant has had several values
# over the years, usually without explanation for the changes.  Although
# APEX had little impact on consumer cameras, it has seen a partial
# resurrection in the Exif standards published by the Camera & Imaging
# Products Association of Japan.

# Units for Photographic Exposure Variables
#
# Practical photography sometimes pays scant attention to units for exposure
# variables.  In particular, the "speed" of the imaging medium is treated as if
# it were dimensionless when it should have units of reciprocal lux seconds;
# this practice works only because "speed" is almost invariably given in
# accordance with international standards (or similar ones used by camera
# manufacturers)--so the assumed units are invariant.  In calculating
# logarithmic quantities--especially the time value Tv and the exposure value
# EV--the units for exposure time ("shutter speed") are often ignored; this
# practice works only because the units of exposure time are assumed to be in
# seconds, and the missing units that make the argument to the logarithmic
# function dimensionless are silently provided.
#
# In keeping with common practice, the definitions that follow treat "speeds"
# as dimensionless, so ISO 100 speed is given simply as '100'.  When
# calculating the logarithmic APEX quantities Av and Tv, the definitions
# provide the missing units, so the times can be given with any appropriate
# units.  For example, giving an exposure time of 1 minute as either '1 min' or
# '60 s' will result in Tv of -5.9068906.
#
# Exposure Value from f-number and Exposure Time
# 
# Because nonlinear unit conversions only accept a single quantity,
# there is no direct conversion from f-number and exposure time to
# exposure value EV.  But the EV can be obtained from a combination of
# Av and Tv.  For example, the "sunny 16" rule states that correct
# exposure for a sunlit scene can achieved by using f/16 and an exposure
# time equal to the reciprocal of the ISO speed in seconds; this can be
# calculated as
#
#    ~Av(16) + ~Tv(1|100 s),
#
# which gives 14.643856.  These conversions may be combined with the
# ev100 conversion:
#
#    ev100(~Av(16) + ~Tv(1|100 s))
#
# to yield the assumed average scene luminance of 3200 cd/m^2.

# convert relative aperture (f-number) to aperture value

# Astronomical time measurements
#
# Astronomical time measurement is a complicated matter.  The length of the
# true day at a given place can be 21 seconds less than 24 hours or 30 seconds
# over 24 hours.  The two main reasons for this are the varying speed of the
# earth in its elliptical orbit and the fact that the sun moves on the ecliptic
# instead of along the celestial equator.  To devise a workable system for time
# measurement, Simon Newcomb (1835-1909) used a fictitious "mean sun".
# Consider a first fictitious sun traveling along the ecliptic at a constant
# speed and coinciding with the true sun at perigee and apogee.  Then
# considering a second fictitious sun traveling along the celestial equator at
# a constant speed and coinciding with the first fictitious sun at the
# equinoxes.  The second fictitious sun is the "mean sun".  From this equations
# can be written out to determine the length of the mean day, and the tropical
# year.  The length of the second was determined based on the tropical year
# from such a calculation and was officially used from 1960-1967 until atomic
# clocks replaced astronomical measurements for a standard of time.  All of the
# values below give the mean time for the specified interval.
#
# See "Mathematical Astronomy Morsels" by Jean Meeus for more details
# and a description of how to compute the correction to mean time.

# Many astronomical values can be measured most accurately in a system of units
# using the astronomical unit and the mass of the sun as base units.  The
# uncertainty in the gravitational constant makes conversion to SI units
# significantly less accurate.

# The astronomical unit was defined to be the length of the of the semimajor
# axis of a massless object with the same year as the earth.  With such a
# definition in force, and with the mass of the sun set equal to one, Kepler's
# third law can be used to solve for the value of the gravitational constant.

# Kepler's third law says that (2 pi / T)^2 a^3 = G M where T is the orbital
# period, a is the size of the semimajor axis, G is the gravitational constant
# and M is the mass.  With M = 1 and T and a chosen for the earth's orbit, we
# find sqrt(G) = (2 pi / T) sqrt(AU^3).  This constant is called the Gaussian
# gravitational constant, apparently because Gauss originally did the
# calculations.  However, when the original calculation was done, the value
# for the length of the earth's year was inaccurate.  The value used is called
# the Gaussian year.  Changing the astronomical unit to bring it into
# agreement with more accurate values for the year would have invalidated a
# lot of previous work, so instead the astronomical unit has been kept equal
# to this original value.  This is accomplished by using a standard value for
# the Gaussian gravitational constant.  This constant is called k.

# Parallax is the angular difference between the topocentric (on Earth's
# surface) and geocentric (at Earth's center) direction toward a celestial body
# when the body is at a given altitude.  When the body is on the horizon, the
# parallax is the horizontal parallax; when the body is on the horizon and the
# observer is on the equator, the parallax is the equatorial horizontal
# parallax.  When the body is at zenith, the parallax is zero.

# Light from celestial objects is attenuated by passage through Earth's
# atmosphere.  A body near the horizon passes through much more air than an
# object at zenith, and is consequently less bright.  Air mass is the ratio of
# the length of the optical path at a given altitude (angle above the horizon)
# to the length at zenith.  Air mass at zenith is by definition unity; at the
# horizon, air mass is approximately 38, though the latter value can vary
# considerably with atmospheric conditions.  The general formula is # E = E0
# exp(-c X), where E0 is the value outside Earth's atmosphere, E is the value
# seen by an observer, X is the air mass and c is the extinction coefficient.
# A common value for c in reasonably clear air is 0.21, but values can be
# considerably greater in urban areas.  Apparent altitude is that perceived by
# an observer; it includes the effect of atmospheric refraction.  There is no
# shortage of formulas for air mass
# (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_mass_(astronomy)); all are subject to
# variations in local atmospheric conditions.  The formula used here is simple
# and is in good agreement with rigorously calculated values under standard
# conditions.

# Visual magnitude of star or other celestial object.  The system of stellar
# magnitudes, developed in ancient Greece, assigned magnitudes from 1
# (brightest) to 6 (faintest visible to the naked eye).  In 1856, British
# astronomer Norman Pogson made the system precise, with a magnitude 1 object
# 100 times as bright as a magnitude 6 object, and each magnitude differing
# from the next by a constant ratio; the ratio, sometimes known as Pogson's
# ratio, is thus 100^0.2, or approximately 2.5119.  The logarithm of 100^0.2 is
# 0.4, hence the common use of powers of 10 and base-10 logarithms.

# Surface brightness of a celestial object of a given visual magnitude

#    S = m + 2.5 log(pi pi k a b),

# linear measure

# The US Metric Law of 1866 legalized the metric system in the USA and
# defined the meter in terms of the British system with the exact
# 1 meter = 39.37 inches.  On April 5, 1893 Thomas Corwin Mendenhall,
# Superintendent of Weights and Measures, decided, in what has become
# known as the "Mendenhall Order" that the meter and kilogram would be the
# fundamental standards in the USA.  The definition from 1866 was turned
# around to give an exact definition of the yard as 3600|3937 meters This
# definition was used until July of 1959 when the definition was changed
# to bring the US and other English-speaking countries into agreement; the
# Canadian value of 1 yard = 0.9144 meter (exactly) was chosen because it
# was approximately halfway between the British and US values; it had the
# added advantage of making 1 inch = 25.4 mm (exactly).  Since 1959, the
# "international" foot has been exactly 0.3048 meters.  At the same time,
# it was decided that any data expressed in feet derived from geodetic
# surveys within the US would continue to use the old definition and call
# the old unit the "survey foot." The US continues to define the statute
# mile, furlong, chain, rod, link, and fathom in terms of the US survey
# foot.

# A unit of alcohol is a specified mass of pure ethyl alcohol.
# The term is used officially in the UK, but other countries use the same
# concept but with different values.  For example, the UK value of 8 g is
# nominally the amount of alcohol that a typical adult can metabolize in
# one hour.  Values for several countries, converted to a volumetric basis:

alcoholunitus           14 g   / ethanoldensity
alcoholunitca           13.6 g / ethanoldensity
alcoholunituk            8 g   / ethanoldensity
alcoholunitau           10 g   / ethanoldensity

# Example: for 12% ABV (alcohol by volume)
# alcoholunitus / 12% = 147.8 mL, close to the “standard” serving of 150 mL.

# British
#

# The length measure in the UK was defined by a bronze bar manufactured in
# 1844.  Various conversions were sanctioned for convenience at different
# times, which makes conversions before 1963 a confusing matter.  Apparently
# previous conversions were never explicitly revoked.  Four different
# conversion factors appear below.  Multiply them times an imperial length
# units as desired.  The Weights and Measures Act of 1963 switched the UK away
# from their bronze standard and onto a definition of the yard in terms of the
# meter.  This happened after an international agreement in 1959 to align the
# world's measurement systems.

# Density measures.  Density has traditionally been measured on a variety of
# bizarre nonlinear scales.
#

# Density of a sugar syrup is frequently measured in candy making procedures.
# In the USA the boiling point of the syrup is measured.  Some recipes instead
# specify the density using degrees Baume.  Conversion between degrees Baume
# and the boiling point measure has proved elusive.  This table appeared in one
# text, and provides a fragmentary relationship to the concentration.

# Heat Transfer
#
# Thermal conductivity, K, measures the rate of heat transfer across
# a material.  The heat transfered is
#     Q = K dT A t / L
# where dT is the temperature difference across the material, A is the
# cross sectional area, t is the time, and L is the length (thickness).
# Thermal conductivity is a material property.

THERMAL_CONDUCTIVITY    POWER / AREA (TEMPERATURE_DIFFERENCE/LENGTH)
THERMAL_RESISTIVITY     1/THERMAL_CONDUCTIVITY

# Thermal conductance is the rate at which heat flows across a given
# object, so the area and thickness have been fixed.  It depends on
# the size of the object and is hence not a material property.

THERMAL_CONDUCTANCE     POWER / TEMPERATURE_DIFFERENCE
THERMAL_RESISTANCE      1/THERMAL_CONDUCTANCE

# Thermal admittance is the rate of heat flow per area across an
# object whose thickness has been fixed.  Its reciprocal, thermal
# insulation, is used to for measuring the heat transfer per area
# of sheets of insulation or cloth that are of specified thickness.

# The bel was defined by engineers of Bell Laboratories to describe the
# reduction in audio level over a length of one mile. It was originally
# called the transmission unit (TU) but was renamed around 1923 to honor
# Alexander Graham Bell. The bel proved inconveniently large so the decibel
# has become more common.  The decibel is dimensionless since it reports a
# ratio, but it is used in various contexts to report a signal's power
# relative to some reference level.

# gsm (Grams per Square Meter), a sane, metric paper weight measure

gsm                     grams / meter^2

# In the USA, a collection of crazy historical paper measures are used.  Paper
# is measured as a weight of a ream of that particular type of paper.  This is
# sometimes called the "substance" or "basis" (as in "substance 20" paper).
# The standard sheet size or "basis size" varies depending on the type of
# paper.  As a result, 20 pound bond paper and 50 pound text paper are actually
# about the same weight.  The different sheet sizes were historically the most
# convenient for printing or folding in the different applications.  These
# different basis weights are standards maintained by American Society for
# Testing Materials (ASTM) and the American Forest and Paper Association
# (AF&PA).

# Gauge pressure functions
#
# Gauge pressure is measured relative to atmospheric pressure.  In the English
# system, where pressure is often given in pounds per square inch, gauge
# pressure is often indicated by 'psig' to distinguish it from absolute
# pressure, often indicated by 'psia'.  At the standard atmospheric pressure
# of 14.696 psia, a gauge pressure of 0 psig is an absolute pressure of 14.696
# psia; an automobile tire inflated to 31 psig has an absolute pressure of
# 45.696 psia.
#
# With gaugepressure(), the units must be specified (e.g., gaugepressure(1.5
# bar)); with psig(), the units are taken as psi, so the example above of tire
# pressure could be given as psig(31).
#
# If the normal elevation is significantly different from sea level, change
# Patm appropriately, and adjust the lower domain limit on the gaugepressure
# definition.

# Wire Gauge
#
# This area is a nightmare with huge charts of wire gauge diameters
# that usually have no clear origin.  There are at least 5 competing wire gauge
# systems to add to the confusion.  The use of wire gauge is related to the
# manufacturing method: a metal rod is heated and drawn through a hole.  The
# size change can't be too big.  To get smaller wires, the process is repeated
# with a series of smaller holes.  Generally larger gauges mean smaller wires.
# The gauges often have values such as "00" and "000" which are larger sizes
# than simply "0" gauge.  In the tables that appear below, these gauges must be
# specified as negative numbers (e.g. "00" is -1, "000" is -2, etc).
# Alternatively, you can use the following units:
#

g00                      (-1)
g000                     (-2)
g0000                    (-3)
g00000                   (-4)
g000000                  (-5)
g0000000                 (-6)

# American Wire Gauge (AWG) or Brown & Sharpe Gauge appears to be the most
# important gauge. ASTM B-258 specifies that this gauge is based on geometric
# interpolation between gauge 0000, which is 0.46 inches exactly, and gauge 36
# which is 0.005 inches exactly.  Therefore, the diameter in inches of a wire
# is given by the formula 1|200 92^((36-g)/39).  Note that 92^(1/39) is close
# to 2^(1/6), so diameter is approximately halved for every 6 gauges.  For the
# repeated zero values, use negative numbers in the formula.  The same document
# also specifies rounding rules which seem to be ignored by makers of tables.
# Gauges up to 44 are to be specified with up to 4 significant figures, but no
# closer than 0.0001 inch.  Gauges from 44 to 56 are to be rounded to the
# nearest 0.00001 inch.
#
# In addition to being used to measure wire thickness, this gauge is used to
# measure the thickness of sheets of aluminum, copper, and most metals other
# than steel, iron and zinc.

# The following is from the Appendix to ASTM B 258
#
#    For example, in U.S. gage, the standard for sheet metal is based on the
#    weight of the metal, not on the thickness. 16-gage is listed as
#    approximately .0625 inch thick and 40 ounces per square foot (the original
#    standard was based on wrought iron at .2778 pounds per cubic inch; steel
#    has almost entirely superseded wrought iron for sheet use, at .2833 pounds
#    per cubic inch). Smaller numbers refer to greater thickness. There is no
#    formula for converting gage to thickness or weight.
#
# It's rather unclear from the passage above whether the plate gauge values are
# therefore wrong if steel is being used.  Reference [15] states that steel is
# in fact measured using this gauge (under the name Manufacturers' Standard
# Gauge) with a density of 501.84 lb/ft3 = 0.2904 lb/in3 used for steel.
# But this doesn't seem to be the correct density of steel (.2833 lb/in3 is
# closer).
#
# This gauge was established in 1893 for purposes of taxation.

# Abrasive grit size
#
# Standards governing abrasive grit sizes are complicated, specifying
# fractions of particles that are passed or retained by different mesh
# sizes.  As a result, it is not possible to make precise comparisons
# of different grit standards.  The tables below allow the
# determination of rough equivlants by using median particle size.
#
# Standards in the USA are determined by the Unified Abrasives
# Manufacturers' Association (UAMA), which resulted from the merger of
# several previous organizations.  One of the old organizations was
# CAMI (Coated Abrasives Manufacturers' Institute).
#
# UAMA has a web page with plots showing abrasive particle ranges for
# various different grits and comparisons between standards.
#
# http://www.uama.org/Abrasives101/101Standards.html
#
# Abrasives are grouped into "bonded" abrasives for use with grinding
# wheels and "coated" abrasives for sandpapers and abrasive films.
# The industry uses different grit standards for these two
# categories.
#
# Another division is between "macrogrits", grits below 240 and
# "microgrits", which are above 240.  Standards differ, as do methods
# for determining particle size.  In the USA, ANSI B74.12 is the
# standard governing macrogrits.  ANSI B74.10 covers bonded microgrit
# abrasives, and ANSI B74.18 covers coated microgrit abrasives.  It
# appears that the coated standard is identical to the bonded standard
# for grits up through 600 but then diverges significantly.
#
# European grit sizes are determined by the Federation of European
# Producers of Abrasives.  http://www.fepa-abrasives.org
#
# They give two standards, the "F" grit for bonded abrasives and the
# "P" grit for coated abrasives.  This data is taken directly from
# their web page.

# FEPA P grit for coated abrasives is commonly seen on sandpaper in
# the USA where the paper will be marked P600, for example.  FEPA P
# grits are said to be more tightly constrained than comparable ANSI
# grits so that the particles are more uniform in size and hence give
# a better finish.

# Like the bonded grit, the coated macrogrits below 240 are taken from the
# FEPA F table.  Data above this is from the UAMA site.  Note that the coated
# and bonded standards are evidently the same from 240 up to 600 grit, but
# starting at 800 grit, the coated standard diverges.  The data from UAMA show
# that 800 grit coated has an average size slightly larger than the average
# size of 600 grit coated/bonded.  However, the 800 grit has a significantly
# smaller particle size variation.
#
# Because of this non-monotonicity from 600 grit to 800 grit this definition
# produces a warning about the lack of a unique inverse.

# Mesh systems for measuring particle sizes by sifting through a wire
# mesh or sieve
#

# The Tyler system and US Sieve system are based on four steps for
# each factor of 2 change in the size, so each size is 2^1|4 different
# from the adjacent sizes.  Unfortunately, the mesh numbers are
# arbitrary, so the sizes cannot be expressed with a functional form.
# Various references round the values differently.  The mesh numbers
# are supposed to correspond to the number of holes per inch, but this
# correspondence is only approximate because it doesn't include the
# wire size of the mesh.

# The Tyler Mesh system was apparently introduced by the WS Tyler
# company, but it appears that they no longer use it.  They follow the
# ASTM E11 standard.

# Ring size. All ring sizes are given as the circumference of the ring.
#

# USA ring sizes.  Several slightly different definitions seem to be in
# circulation.  According to [15], the interior diameter of size n ring in
# inches is 0.32 n + 0.458 for n ranging from 3 to 13.5 by steps of 0.5.  The
# size 2 ring is inconsistently 0.538in and no 2.5 size is listed.
#
# However, other sources list 0.455 + 0.0326 n and 0.4525 + 0.0324 n as the
# diameter and list no special case for size 2.  (Or alternatively they are
# 1.43 + .102 n and 1.4216+.1018 n for measuring circumference in inches.)  One
# reference claimed that the original system was that each size was 1|10 inch
# circumference, but that source doesn't have an explanation for the modern
# system which is somewhat different.

# Old practice in the UK measured rings using the "Wheatsheaf gauge" with sizes
# specified alphabetically and based on the ring inside diameter in steps of
# 1|64 inch.  This system was replaced in 1987 by British Standard 6820 which
# specifies sizes based on circumference.  Each size is 1.25 mm different from
# the preceding size.  The baseline is size C which is 40 mm circumference.
# The new sizes are close to the old ones.  Sometimes it's necessary to go
# beyond size Z to Z+1, Z+2, etc.

# Atomic weights.  The atomic weight of an element is the ratio of the mass of
# a mole of the element to 1|12 of a mole of Carbon 12.  The Standard Atomic
# Weights apply to the elements as they occur naturally on earth.  Elements
# which do not occur naturally or which occur with wide isotopic variability do
# not have Standard Atomic Weights.  For these elements, the atomic weight is
# based on the longest lived isotope, as marked in the comments.  In some
# cases, the comment for these entries also gives a number which is an atomic
# weight for a different isotope that may be of more interest than the longest
# lived isotope.

# Traditional Japanese units (shakkanhou)
#
# The traditional system of weights and measures is called shakkanhou from the
# shaku and the ken.  Japan accepted SI units in 1891 and legalized conversions
# to the traditional system.  In 1909 the inch-pound system was also legalized,
# so Japan had three legally approved systems.  A change to the metric system
# started in 1921 but there was a lot of resistance.  The Measurement Law of
# October 1999 prohibits sales in anything but SI units.  However, the old
# units still live on in construction and as the basis for paper sizes of books
# and tools used for handicrafts.
#
# Note that units below use the Hepburn romanization system.  Some other
# systems would render "mou", "jou", and "chou" as "mo", "jo" and "cho".

# Japanese Length Measures

# Japanese architecture is based on a "standard" size of tatami mat.
# Room sizes today are given in number of tatami, and this number
# determines the spacing between colums and hence sizes of sliding
# doors and paper screens.  However, every region has its own slightly
# different tatami size.  Edoma, used in and around Tokyo and
# Hokkaido, is becoming a nationwide standard.  Kyouma is used around
# Kyoto, Osaka and Kyuushu, and Chuukyouma is used around Nagoya.
# Note that the tatami all have the aspect ratio 2:1 so that the mats
# can tile the room with some of them turned 90 degrees.

#                 Omitted because there are no other units for this
#                 dimension.  Is this true?  What about CCS = 1/36 erlang?
#                 Erlang is supposed to be dimensionless.  One erlang means
#                 a single channel occupied for one hour.
