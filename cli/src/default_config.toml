# You can define custom units via a `custom-units` array. If there's
# a unit you would like to see added to fend, please consider making
# a pull request to add it to the built-in unit definitions.
#
# Example syntax:
# ```
# [[custom-units]]
# singular = 'mile'
# plural = 'miles'  # plural name can be omitted if it is
#                   # the same as the singular name
# definition = '1609.344 meters'
# attribute = 'allow_long_prefix'
# ```
#
# If the singular and plural names are the same, you can omit
# the `plural` setting.
#
# The `attribute` setting is optional. It can be set
# to one of these values:
#   * 'none': this unit cannot be used with prefixes (default)
#   * 'allow-long-prefix': allow prefixes like
#         'milli-' or 'giga-' with this unit
#   * 'allow-short-prefix': allow abbreviated
#         prefixes like 'm' or 'G' (for 'milli' and 'giga' respectively)
#   * 'is-long-prefix': allow using this unit
#         as a long prefix with another unit
#   * 'alias': always expand this unit to its definition
#
# Here are some more examples of how you could define custom units:
#
# ```
# [[custom-units]]
# singular = 'milli'
# definition = '0.001'
# attribute = 'is_long_prefix'
#
# [[custom-units]]
# singular = 'byte'
# plural = 'bytes'
# definition = '!' # an exclamation mark defines a new base unit
# attribute = 'allow_long_prefix'
# ```
