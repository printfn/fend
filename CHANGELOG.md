## Changelog

### v1.0.4 (2022-07-22)

* Support `kn` for `knots`
* Add an installer for Windows

### v1.0.3 (2022-06-07)

* Support `rad` for `radians` (e.g. `10 RPM to rad/s`)
* Support implicit inches for `feet` (e.g. `5 foot 5 to cm`)
* Ensure fend does not exit when pressing Ctrl-C to clear the current line

### v1.0.2 (2022-06-01)

* Improve CLI colors
* Use Coulomb and Farad for prefixed units like `mC` or `µF`
* Add `sqmm` unit for square millimeters
* Add `point` unit for typographical points (i.e. 1/72 inch)
* Improve CLI behavior when pressing Ctrl-C to clear the current line

### v1.0.1 (2022-03-19)

* Support omitting inches when writing e.g. `5'1`: fend will now automatically
    interpret that as `5'1"`
* Improve reliability when piping data into fend on the command line, e.g.
    when running `echo "1+1" | fend`
* Support compiling fend with Rust 1.56 (rather than requiring Rust 1.59)

### v1.0.0 (2022-03-12)

* Allow `kmh` and `km/h` for kilometers per hour
* Change Planck's constant from `h` to `planck`
* Add support for lambda notation `λx.x` (in addition to the previous
    lambda notations `\x.x`, `x:x` and `x => x`)
* Add a ZSH helper script that makes `fend` more convenient on the
    command line
* Despite the major version bump, this release contains no breaking
    API changes

### v0.1.29 (2022-02-23)

* The locations for the config and history files have changed on some operating
    systems. On Linux and macOS, fend will now look in `~/.config/fend/config.toml`
    for its configuration file, and store history in `~/.local/state/fend/history`.
    You can run `fend help` to see which paths fend uses, and override them
    via the `FEND_CONFIG_DIR` and `FEND_STATE_DIR` environment variables
    if necessary.
* Colors in the CLI are now enabled by default. They can be disabled via the
    `enable-colors` config option, or via the `NO_COLOR` environment variable.
    `CLICOLOR` and `CLICOLOR_FORCE` environment variables are also respected.
    See https://bixense.com/clicolors/ and https://no-color.org for more info.
* Add a `max-history-size` config option to control how many history entries are
    saved by default.
* Improve error-checking when reading the config file. Minor errors will now only
    produce warnings, and no longer cause parsing to fail entirely.
* There are now Linux ARM builds available, for both `armv7-gnueabihf` and
    `aarch64` architectures.

### v0.1.28 (2022-02-12)

* Add base names `ternary` and `senary`
* Reduce CLI binary sizes

### v0.1.27 (2021-11-02)

* Improve command-line argument parsing, including support for multiple arguments
* The most recent calculation result is now stored in a special variable `_` (or `ans`):
    ```
    > 5 * 10
    50
    > _ + 5
    55
    > _ * 2
    110
    > ans * 2
    220
    ```

    ```
    > roll d6
    4
    > roll d20 # 20-sided die
    17
    > roll 2d6 # sum of two 6-sided dice
    7
    > 2d6 # view the probability distribution

* Add `mixed_frac` as an alias for `mixed_fraction`
* Support the `£` symbol for GBP
* Allow `$` and `£` before the associated number, e.g. `$100/4` is `$25`

### v0.1.17 (2021-06-08)

* Add `k`, `M`, `G` and `T` suffixes for numbers (e.g. `5k` is `5000`)
* Add a modulo operator `mod` (e.g. `5 mod 2` is `1`)

* Fix incorrect currency exchange rates
* Add `true`, `false`, and a `not()` function

### v0.1.16 (2021-05-21)

* Add support for Unicode operators, such as ✕ or ÷
* Add color customization to the command-line interface by editing the `config.toml` file. Refer to the default `config.toml` file [here](https://github.com/printfn/fend/blob/main/cli/src/default_config.toml).

### v0.1.15 (2021-05-20)

* Case-insensitive units: you can now write `5 Meters`
* Experimental date support:
  * You can create a date object like so:
    ```
    > "2021-05-20" to date
    Thursday, 20 May 2021
    ```
  * No other date-related functionality has been implemented yet, including no times/timezones, durations, date arithmetic or different date formats.
* fend now parses single and double quotes as feet and inches (instead of as string literals) in more situations, so you can once again write:
    ```
    > 1.2192 m to '
    4'
    ```
* The CLI program can now read options from a config file. Type `help` to find out where it is stored. The `config.toml` file can contain the following options:
    ```toml
    prompt = '> '
    color = false
    ```
* Terminal color support: this is disabled by default, so you'll need to create a config file containing `color = true` first.

* Improve consistency around error messages
